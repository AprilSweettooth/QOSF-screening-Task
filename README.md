# Task 4

A common challenge in the design and implementation of quantum circuits is that they become too extensive and complex due to the large number of qubits required. 

The number of quantum operations and the interdependence between qubits can further complicate the problem, making some traditional optimization methods ineffective or insufficient for reducing the complexity. Additionally, as the number of qubits increases, the fidelity of the circuit may be affected, which implies a greater need for advanced techniques to maintain the precision of operations.

On the other hand, some quantum computing frameworks offer predefined optimization methods that may seem like a convenient option. However, they are not always the best alternative if one has a deep understanding of the quantum hardware structure. Customizing the circuits by taking advantage of the specific features of the quantum device in use can result in a more efficient design, better adapted to the physical limitations of the system. Therefore, having a solid understanding of the hardware can make the difference between a generic quantum circuit and one that is highly optimized for performance.

Consider the following code as input

```ruby
import numpy as np
size = 5
state_values = [22,17,27,12]
state_vector = [0]*2**size
for s in state_values:
   print(np.binary_repr(s,size))
   state_vector[s] = 0.5
np.asarray(state_vector)
```

Find a quantum circuit that represents the state vector with a depth less than 50, using the basis_gates=[x,h,rz,cx] and the following architecture
